A Unity3D protoype game that implements the Marching Cubes algorithm for 3D terrain deformation, similar to the Worms series of games. The project utilizes Unity3D's multi-threaded Job System to support realtime continous terrain updates at an acceptable FPS.
The project also uses the plugin xNode for a visual node graph system to combine various noise inputs and filters for terrain generation presets.

*Disclaimer: The purpose of this project was to develop a better understanding of the Marching Cubes algorithm and how to implement it. The code is not in a releasable state and the project is discontinued.*
